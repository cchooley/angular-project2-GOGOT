# GOGOT - The Game of Game of Thrones

![site image](gogot.jpg)

This app is demos a crucial aspect of a larger, long-term project called GOGOT that I am working on another colleague. We came up with the idea for this game before Game of Thrones’ fifth season that kind of caught fire - essentially formatting the “Survivor Pool” NFL game to apply to HBO's Game of Thrones.

The GOGOT app, including this demo version, is chiefly designed to administer and record weekly selections. This would be something that could identify a player, present them with the eligible characters for selection, log their pick and display the week’s selections. All in an efficient and stylish way.
