Galvanize Web App
For this project, you will build a light application that reads data, has end-to-end testing, and integrates with an API. The topic is up to you, so pick a project that speaks to your interests.

Instructions
You should have a brochure page that has information about what your app does and who it's for.
Your app should make a GET request to an external API
Your app should also pull from a second source of data. This can be another API, another endpoint on the same API, or from a local .json file
You need to write some data transformation that combines the two objects in a meaningful way
The resulting data should be dynamically added to the page
You should allow a user to change the API end point. For example, get data about a specific movie, weather for a specific zip code, etc
Your app should have end-to-end tests
Deploy your app
